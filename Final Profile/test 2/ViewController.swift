By taking this class, I intend to make an app that would be sleek as well as user friendly. I started progamming about a year ago. At first, I was into making websites using HTML and CSS. Now, I want to broaden my knowledge in computer science. I am really excited for this class as I want to challenge myself to greater extent and learn new things."
